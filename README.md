# Pet Adoption Platform - Back End

This repository contains the back-end code for a full-stack pet adoption platform. The goal of this platform is to allow users to sign up, search, and adopt pets. The back-end has been built with SQL and Node.js, providing a robust and efficient API for our front-end.

One year after the initial release, the back-end code has undergone significant refactoring to enhance performance, security, and maintainability. This refactoring process followed industry best practices to ensure high quality and efficient server-side logic.
